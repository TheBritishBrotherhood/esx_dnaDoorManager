# esx_dnaDoorManager
Syncable doors

So today I present to you a ported/converted copy of @Darklandz DRdoors! (Thank you darklandz for your awsome resource) Check out the original repo here > dRdoors 34

FEATURES:

Ability to lock PD doors (and others if you add them) :key:
Only police can unlock and lock these doors :policeman:
Synced with the Database! :card_file_box:
– This is the biggest diffrence from other resources such as esx_doorlock
Easily add more doors to be locked!
Neat and tidy DrawTxt label (Small, Simple and clean) :memo:
Editable door locked messges (see in client.lua)
Ability to change how long it takes for the door to lock and unlock (helps with making the door lock in its appropriate place)
– In c_doors.lua Line 76 & 79 you can change the value there.
:warning: Make sure to run the .sql file included for the doors to sync. :warning:
